        <p class="passage">Technology can feel very overwhelming and vast. There are no bounds to what we can create with a website. We don't have to all <span class="change">create</span> the same layout and sizes with our design elements because our canvas is not set. Rather than taking a canvas and adding elements on top, web designers can design elements and compile them together before binding the canvas together. Also, websites can change to respond to the browser's size. This gives us flexibility to offer an infinite stream of content that flows with our design.
