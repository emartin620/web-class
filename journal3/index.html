    <div class="one" data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="1500">
        <p>I have learned a great deal in this class. As a computer science minor, I had some prior experience with coding html, css, and javascript. Rather than focusing on learning the technical aspects of coding websites, I really enjoyed learning about web development through the lens of visual arts. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="two" data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="1500">
        <p>In my courses in the computer science department we really just focused on making the code work without giving a second thought to how it looked to the user. In this course, the creative freedom we had to explore different ways to lay out websites was inspiring. I feel like I really stepped out of my comfort zone with trying new things. 
        </p>

    <div class="three" data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="1500">
        <p>I learned how limitless the possibilities are with web design. I used to see web design as a series of boxes, but now I see that you have the power to do whatever you want with a website, not just stack boxes. There are no bounds to web design. The designer gets to decide how space is used.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="four" data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-duration="1500">
        <p>In the future, I want to learn more about javascript features. I also want to keep stepping out of my comfort zone to see what I can do with combining server-side programming, app development, and web design. Even though Iâ€™m not sure what I want to do as a career, I know that I want to keep designing and developing websites. This class was one of my favorites and I know I will come back to reference what I have learned. </p>
