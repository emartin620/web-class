                <p>	The Impressionist era took place during the mid-to-late nineteenth century in France. The artists were united by their desire to break off from strictly academic artforms. They held an annual salon every year called the “Salon des Refusés,” translating to exhibition of rejects. Impressionist art was critiqued because of its use of intense colors and small brush strokes. Many people at the time found the style to be offensive and controversial. Impressionism is largely considered to be the first modern art movement because of its connection to modernization. With the invention of the railroad, artists would travel outside of Paris to paint more remote scenes. The name Impressionsim comes from Monet's painting called "Impression, Sunrise" and a critique of it saying that the artists were only painting "impressions."

                <p>Stylistically, impressionist painters separated themselves from traditional artists by removing themselves from the studio. They painted wherever inspiration struck out in the world, “en plein air.” Other impressionist artists found inspiration indoors in places such as cafes, ballet studios, and other scenes of modern life. Short paint strokes applied in opaque layers made a blurry effect. They didn't seek the perfect, real image that previous art styles did. Brighter colors made by synthetic pigments were shocking and gave paintings dimensions of light. Impressionism is known for the expression of moving light in its landscapes. Portraits were more unposed than more traditional portrait scenes. They conveyed reality through motion.
