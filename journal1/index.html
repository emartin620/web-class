    <p class="text">A website is a tool we use to communicate. We can send all kinds of information using websites. They are not limited to one subject or purpose. There are many different reasons why you may use or create a website. It is a way we can organize information while making it more accessible and aesthetic. 
    </p>
    <p class="text">Websites can be used for both good and bad. There are lots of examples of websites that are made for good reasons, to help people and spread useful information. However, other websites are made to hurt people through things such as cyberbullying. 
    </p>
    <p class="text">We put things on the internet in order to reach a wider audience. If we used other forms of communication such as putting posters up in our own neighborhoods, our messages would not be heard as far away as they do online. Websites can reach all the way across the world. 
    </p>
    <p class="text">Also, websites can be updated, redesigned, and shared more easily than other forms of media. Over the years, we can change content on our sites and our audience still knows where to find it. Web design allows us to communicate the feel of the site immediately when we click on it. For things like stores, designers may need to change the feel of the site with the passing seasons. 
    </p>
    <p class="text">I do not think websites will become obsolete anytime soon. Even though the web is changing with new possibilities, I believe that they will continue to revolve around websites. For example, social media, AI, and businesses still need to use websites to be successful. I think the web development process will continue to change with new technologies, but we will still use websites.
