    <p class="review1"> "I devoured Daisy Jones & The Six in a day, falling head over heels for it. Taylor Jenkins Reid transported me into the magic of the 70's music scene in a way I'll never forget. The characters were beautifully layered and complex...Daisy and the band captured my heart, and they're sure to capture yours too." <br> - Reese Witherspoon
    </p>
    <p class="review2">"A deep dive into the best band you've never heard of." <br> - Marie Claire</p>
    <p class="review3" >"Taylor Jenkins Reid has written a stylish and propulsive if sometimes sentimental novel set against that backdrop, in the stadiums, studios and pool houses of late-1970s L.A…easily her most sophisticated and ambitious novel… In the end, that's the most surprising gift of Daisy Jones & The Six - it's a way to love the rock n roll of the 1970s, without apology, without cynicism, bell-bottoms and all." <br> - New York Times Book Review

    <p class="summary">"Everyone knows Daisy Jones & The Six, but nobody knows the real reason why they split at the absolute height of their popularity…until now.</p><br>

    <p class="summary">Daisy is a girl coming of age in L.A. in the late sixties, sneaking into clubs on the Sunset Strip, sleeping with rock stars, and dreaming of singing at the Whisky a Go-Go. The sex and drugs are thrilling, but it's the rock and roll she loves most. By the time she's twenty, her voice is getting noticed, and she has the kind of heedless beauty that makes people do crazy things.</p><br>
        
    <p class="summary">Another band getting noticed is The Six, led by the brooding Billy Dunne. On the eve of their first tour, his girlfriend Camila finds out she's pregnant, and with the pressure of impending fatherhood and fame, Billy goes a little wild on the road.</p><br>
        
    <p class="summary">Daisy and Billy cross paths when a producer realizes the key to supercharged success is to put the two together. What happens next will become the stuff of legend." - taylorjenkinsreid.com</p>
